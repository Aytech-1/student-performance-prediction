## Introduction

In today's educational landscape, understanding the factors that contribute to a student's academic performance is crucial for educators, parents, and policymakers. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict a student's performance in mathematics based on various factors. By providing accurate predictions, this tool can help identify students who may need additional support and tailor educational strategies accordingly.

## Note: This project is for Educational Purposes Only

The Student Exam Performance Predictor project is developed to showcase the application of machine learning techniques in predicting student performance. The results obtained from this project are based on a specific dataset and machine learning model, and should not be considered as definitive or accurate predictions for real-world scenarios. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of developing a machine learning model and provide insights into the factors influencing student performance.

## Features

Predicts student performance in mathematics based on multiple factors.

Provides insights into the influence of gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course on student performance.

User-friendly interface for inputting student information and obtaining predictions.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Aytech-1/student-performance-prediction.git


## Navigate to the project directory:

cd student-performance-prediction


## Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the application:

python app.py


Access the web interface in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

Fill in the student information and submit the form to obtain the predicted math score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the machine learning model is sourced from Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams
.
It contains information about students' demographics, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, and their corresponding exam scores.

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost) to predict the math score based on the input features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of around 85% in predicting student performance in mathematics. The results demonstrate the significant impact of factors such as parental education, test preparation course, and lunch type on student scores.
